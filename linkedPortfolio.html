            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> <strong>Alexis</strong> is a 26-year-old GIS Data Analyst and aspiring software engineer. Originally
                born in California, Alexis grew up in Orange County before moving to St. Louis in 2017 to begin college
                at <a href="https://washu.edu" color=black>Washington University</a>. Alexis was born on September
                1<sup>st</sup>, making him a virgo, and while he knows
                little about astrology charts, he's been told he fits the description <em>perfectly</em>. Maybe even
                <em>too</em> perfectly...
            </p>
            <p>In his free time, Alexis enjoys playing and watching tennis - although he is <strong>much</strong> better
                at the latter in case anybody was curious. He is a lover of live music, attending concerts whenever he
                can, and an avid patron of his local theaters. Outside of these hobbies, Alexis can also be found
                scouring town for Pokémon cards, taking long walks through the park, or catching a bite to eat with
                friends around town. </p>
